# Rust Learning Path - From Professional to Rustacean

## Your Background Advantages
- **TypeScript**: Understanding of strong typing, generics, and modern language features
- **Python**: High-level abstractions and pythonic thinking
- **Java**: OOP concepts, memory management basics

## Curriculum Overview

### Phase 1: Foundations (Lessons 1-4)
1. **Setup & Basic Syntax** - Variables, types, control flow
2. **Ownership & Borrowing** - Rust's killer feature (most important!)
3. **Structs & Enums** - Data structures the Rust way
4. **Error Handling** - Result and Option types

### Phase 2: Intermediate (Lessons 5-8)
5. **Collections & Iterators** - Vectors, HashMaps, powerful iteration
6. **Traits** - Rust's answer to interfaces/protocols
7. **Lifetimes** - Understanding references deeply
8. **Generics & Advanced Types** - Type system mastery

### Phase 3: Professional Rust (Lessons 9-12)
9. **Modules & Crates** - Code organization
10. **Testing & Documentation** - Professional practices
11. **Concurrency** - Fearless parallelism
12. **Async/Await** - Modern async programming

### Phase 4: Real-World Projects
- CLI tool
- Web server
- Concurrent system
